# bluedot-react-native

Bluedot React Native is a wrapper around the [Android Point SDK](https://docs.bluedot.io/android-sdk/) and [iOS Point SDK](https://docs.bluedot.io/ios-sdk/), allowing for Bluedot integration in React Native apps.
Functionality is provided through one single npm package so you can use it for both platforms without downloading any extra packages.
